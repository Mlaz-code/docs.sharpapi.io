## What is Expected Value?

Expected Value (EV) measures the average profit or loss per bet over time.

```
EV = (Probability of Winning × Profit) - (Probability of Losing × Stake)
```

A **positive EV (+EV)** bet is profitable long-term.

## Simple Example

**Coin flip at +110 odds:**

- Win probability: 50%
- Win payout: $110
- Lose amount: $100

```
EV = (0.50 × $110) - (0.50 × $100)
EV = $55 - $50
EV = +$5 per $100 bet (5% EV)
```

> **Tip:**
  A 5% EV means you expect to profit $5 for every $100 wagered over time.


## SharpAPI's EV Calculation

We use **Pinnacle** (a sharp book) as the source of truth for "fair" probability.

### Step 1: Get Sharp Book Odds

```
Pinnacle odds: Team A -115 / Team B +105
```

### Step 2: Remove the Vig

```javascript
// Implied probabilities (with vig)
probA = 1 / 1.87 = 0.535  // -115
probB = 1 / 2.05 = 0.488  // +105
total = 1.023  // 2.3% vig

// No-vig (fair) probabilities
fairProbA = 0.535 / 1.023 = 0.523 (52.3%)
fairProbB = 0.488 / 1.023 = 0.477 (47.7%)
```

### Step 3: Compare to Soft Book

```
DraftKings odds: Team A -105 (decimal 1.952)
Fair probability: 52.3%

EV% = (fairProb × decimalOdds - 1) × 100
EV% = (0.523 × 1.952 - 1) × 100
EV% = +2.1%
```

## The EV Formula

```
EV% = (fair_probability × decimal_odds - 1) × 100
```

Where:
- `fair_probability` = No-vig probability from sharp book
- `decimal_odds` = Soft book odds in decimal format

## Why This Works

| Book Type | Characteristics |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Sharp (Pinnacle)** | Low vig, efficient odds, accurate probabilities |
| **Soft (DraftKings)** | Higher vig, slower to adjust, exploitable |

When soft books are slow to adjust, their odds imply a lower probability than reality = **+EV opportunity**.

## EV Thresholds

| EV % | Quality | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| < 0% | Negative EV | Never bet |
| 0-2% | Marginal | High volume only |
| **2-5%** | Good | Standard threshold |
| **5%+** | Excellent | High confidence |

> **Note:**
  SharpAPI's default threshold is 2% EV. Adjust with the `threshold` parameter.


## Variance Warning

+EV doesn't guarantee profit on every bet:

```
100 bets at +5% EV, $100 each:
- Expected profit: $500
- Actual results: Anywhere from -$2000 to +$3000

With 1000 bets:
- Results converge toward +$5000
```

> **Warning:**
  EV is a long-term concept. Short-term variance can be brutal. Never bet more than you can afford to lose.
