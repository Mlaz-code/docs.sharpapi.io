## What is Arbitrage?

Arbitrage ("arb") exploits price differences between sportsbooks to guarantee profit regardless of outcome.

```
Book A: Team X +150 (implied 40%)
Book B: Team Y -130 (implied 56.5%)
Total implied: 96.5% < 100% = ARBITRAGE
```

## How It Works

### Example: Two-Way Market

**Game: Lakers vs Warriors**

| Sportsbook | Selection | Odds | Implied Prob |
|------------|-----------|------|--------------|
| DraftKings | Lakers | +145 | 40.8% |
| Pinnacle | Warriors | -135 | 57.4% |
| **Total** | | | **98.2%** |

Since 98.2% < 100%, arbitrage exists!

**Profit calculation:**
```
Profit % = (100 / 98.2) - 100 = 1.83%
```

### Calculating Stakes

To guarantee equal return regardless of outcome:

```javascript
const total = 1/2.45 + 1/1.74;  // Sum of implied probs
const stake1 = (1/2.45) / total;  // 41.5%
const stake2 = (1/1.74) / total;  // 58.5%
```

**With $1000 total:**

| Bet | Stake | Odds | If Wins |
|-----|-------|------|---------|
| Lakers @ DK | $415 | +145 | $1,017 |
| Warriors @ Pinnacle | $585 | -135 | $1,018 |

**Guaranteed profit: ~$18 (1.8%)**

## Three-Way Markets

Soccer and hockey have draws, creating 3-way arbs:

```
Team A: +200 (33.3%)
Draw:   +250 (28.6%)
Team B: +180 (35.7%)
Total: 97.6% → 2.4% arb
```

## Why Arbs Exist

1. **Timing differences** - Books update at different speeds
2. **Opinion differences** - Books have different risk models
3. **Promotions** - Boosted odds create artificial arbs
4. **Errors** - Occasionally, a book makes a mistake

## Arb Hunting Challenges

> **Warning:**
**Sportsbooks don't like arbers:**
- Accounts get limited or banned
- Withdrawals may be delayed
- You may be restricted to small bets


### Tips to Avoid Detection

1. **Round bet amounts** - $47.32 looks suspicious, $50 doesn't
2. **Mix in recreational bets** - Don't only bet arbs
3. **Withdraw gradually** - Large withdrawals trigger reviews
4. **Use multiple accounts** - Spread action (where legal)

## Arb vs EV Betting

| Aspect | Arbitrage | +EV Betting |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Risk | Zero (guaranteed) | Variance exists |
| Profit per bet | 1-3% typical | 2-10% edge |
| Account risk | High (limits) | Lower |
| Capital required | High (both sides) | Lower |
| Sustainability | Limited | Long-term viable |

> **Tip:**
  Many sharp bettors prefer +EV over arb because accounts last longer and edges are often larger.
